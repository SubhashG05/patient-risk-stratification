# Patient Risk Stratification Model

A machine learning-based clinical decision support tool that predicts patient readmission risk and ICU transfer risk using electronic health record data. This application helps healthcare providers identify high-risk patients, prioritize care, and optimize resource allocation.

## Features

- **Risk Prediction**: Predict patient readmission risk or ICU transfer risk
- **Risk Stratification**: Categorize patients into risk levels for targeted interventions
- **Interactive Dashboard**: User-friendly interface for clinical decision support
- **Model Explainability**: Interpret model predictions to understand risk factors
- **Batch Processing**: Analyze multiple patients simultaneously
- **Performance Metrics**: Visualize model accuracy and other key metrics

## ðŸš€ Deployment Options

This application can be deployed using either **Streamlit Cloud** for quick testing or **AWS EC2 with Docker** for a production-ready deployment.

---

### ðŸ“Œ 1. Deployment on Streamlit Cloud

1. **Upload Code to GitHub**
    - Make sure your repository contains all necessary files:
      - `app.py`
      - `requirements.txt`
      - Any data files (if required).

2. **Sign in to Streamlit Cloud**
    - Go to [https://streamlit.io/cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) and sign in using your GitHub account.

3. **Deploy the App**
    - Click on **"New app"**.
    - Connect your GitHub repository.
    - Choose the `main` branch and select `app.py` as the main file.
    - Click **"Deploy"**.

4. **Access the App**
    - Streamlit will provide a URL like:  
      `https://yourusername-yourrepo.streamlit.app`
    - The app is publicly accessible over HTTPS.

---

### ðŸ“Œ 2. Deployment on AWS EC2 with Docker

Deploy the application on an EC2 instance using Docker for better control, scalability, and potential HTTPS configuration.

#### Steps:

1. **Provision EC2 Instance**
    - Launch an EC2 instance (Ubuntu 20.04 recommended).
    - Choose appropriate instance type (e.g., t2.micro for testing, t3.medium for production).
    - Configure the security group to allow inbound traffic on port 8501 (Streamlit).

2. **Upload Project Files**
    - From your local machine, use `scp` to upload your zipped project folder:
      ```bash
      scp -i "path/to/your-key.pem" patient_model.zip ubuntu@<EC2-Public-IP>:/home/ubuntu/
      ```
    - SSH into the instance:
      ```bash
      ssh -i "path/to/your-key.pem" ubuntu@<EC2-Public-IP>
      ```
    - Unzip the project:
      ```bash
      unzip patient_model.zip
      cd "Patient risk stratification model"
      ```

3. **Build Docker Image**
    - Ensure Docker is installed on the EC2 instance.
    - Build the Docker image:
      ```bash
      sudo docker build -t patient-risk-app .
      ```

4. **Run Docker Container**
    - Run the container:
      ```bash
      sudo docker run -d -p 8501:8501 patient-risk-app
      ```
    - Access the app at:
      ```
      http://<EC2-Public-IP>:8501
      ```

5. **Snapshot**
    - ![EC2 Docker Deployment Screenshot](DockerDeployment.png)

#### Notes:
- Docker ensures consistent environments, easy versioning, and containerized deployment.
- For production, consider:
  - HTTPS termination using a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx).
  - Configuring a custom domain with SSL.
  - Auto-scaling via ECS/EKS for high availability.

## Development

This project was developed as a portfolio project for a data science role in healthcare. The key steps in the development process were:

1. **Data Collection**: Utilizing open-source healthcare datasets for model training
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Understanding the characteristics and patterns in patient data
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating relevant features for risk prediction
4. **Model Development**: Training and evaluating different machine learning algorithms
5. **Application Development**: Building an interactive web application using Streamlit
6. **Model Interpretation**: Implementing SHAP for model explainability

## Future Improvements

- Implement a time-series analysis component for longitudinal patient data
- Add support for more risk prediction targets (e.g., mortality, length of stay)
- Integrate with external EHR systems for real-time data access
- Develop a clinical validation framework for model verification
- Add collaborative filtering for treatment recommendations
